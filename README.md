# Re-flickr - React.js
Made for a quick four hour hackathon to test out frameworks for use in a mobile product. The goal was to call an API and test out rendering extremely long list views. I used the reapp UI library for fast iteration without having to worry about mobile styling. The app calls the Flickr API to display a list of images based on any given search term.

<b>To run:</b>
- Clone into any directory
- ```npm install```
- ```reapp run```
